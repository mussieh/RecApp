# Recapp
Recapp is an Android application designed to recommend well-reviewed resources including books, videos, and websites on selected subjects in Computer Science. The app is a work in progress and will be demonstrated in May of 2018. 
The goal of the application is to help students find excellent academic resources quickly and conveniently.

**Currently, the following have been implemented in the app:**

* Sample subject recommendation
* Extensive ConstraintLayout use for creating a responsive UI
* Maximal Fragment usage for better application modularity
* Full-text search through Algolia
* Firebase Realtime Database support
* Use of the Glide image loading library for fast and efficient image loading
* Personal list with draggable (dismissable) cardview items
* Sample subject settings
* Master/detail navigation flow for sample book data

**Working on:**

* Adding support for YoutubePlayerFragment to play Youtube videos inside the app
* Adding support for Chrome Custom tabs to display websites inside the app
* Hooking up the Fragments with real data
* Polishing the UI and performing Espresso tests

**Stretch goals:**

* Adding user accounts with authentication
* Adding more subjects
* Further polishing the app with custom themes, icons and fluid animations
